Using your first program compute the shortest paths
for the following word pairs :

print paint
forty fifty
cheat solve
worry happy
smile frown
small large
black white
greed money


For example, we expect the following results: 

word1 = forty
word2 = fifty
shortest word ladder of length 4
example shortest word ladder:
    forty
    forth
    firth
    fifth
    fifty


word1 = cheat
word2 = solve
shortest word ladder of length 13
example shortest word ladder:
    cheat
    chert
    chart
    charm
    chasm
    chase
    cease
    lease
    leave
    heave
    helve
    halve
    salve
    solve


size of dictionary = 1638
word1 = worry
word2 = happy
no word ladder exists




--------------------------------------------
Using your second program of the exercise compute
the shortest path for the following word pairs (note
the first few can also be used to test the correctness
of the distance you have computed):

blare blase
blond blood
allow alloy
cheat solve
worry happy
print paint
small large
black white
greed money


For example, we expect the following results: 

word = allow
word = alloy
minimum path distance 2

word = cheat
word = solve
minimum path distance 96

word = worry
word = happy
no path exists
